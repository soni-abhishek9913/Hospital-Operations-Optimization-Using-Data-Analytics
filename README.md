# Hospital-Operations-Optimization-Using-Data-Analytics


This case study presents a comprehensive data analytics approach to optimize hospital operations. By analyzing patient flow, doctor scheduling, and resource utilization, we identify bottlenecks and propose data-driven solutions that reduce waiting time, improve staff allocation, and enhance patient experience.
 
This case study presents a Core Recommendations: To achieve the key objectives (reduce waiting time, optimize schedules, improve utilization, and forecast trends), we recommend implementing predictive scheduling tied to patient inflow, adding diagnostic staff during peak Radiology hours, and deploying real-time dashboards for patient flow tracking. Data driven management is essential for improving staff productivity and the overall patient experience
